Todoodle
========

Todoodle is a thoughts-taking application which provides the user with an
intelligent rich-text editor augmented by a couple of convenience functions.

To compile Todoodle you need Qt 4. Use the following commands:

  qmake
  make
  make install  (you probably need to be root to execute this command)
  
Todoodle was tested under Linux and Windows and should work out of the box on
both systems. As it doesn't has any special dependencies and uses the standard
Qt build system it should also compile under MacOS. This wasn't tested, though.

Class documentation can be generated with Doxygen. Simply run the doxygen
command in the main directory and the documentation will be generated in HTML
format in the html sub directory.

User documentation can be found in the manual subdirectory. When starting
Todoodle for the first time it is shown by default. You can also read it by
starting Todoodle with the manual directory name as command line argument.

Todoodle is released under the GPL.
